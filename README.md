# Mongo-DB
MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database that stores data in JSON-like documents. Unlike relational databases with rigid schemas, MongoDB offers flexibility by allowing documents to have different structures. This makes it a good fit for storing data that's constantly evolving or doesn't easily fit into a predefined schema.  

Here are some key things to know about MongoDB:

* **Document-oriented:** Data is stored in flexible documents, similar to JSON objects.
* **NoSQL:**  Doesn't rely on tables with rows and columns like traditional relational databases.
* **Scalable:** Can handle large datasets and high traffic.
* **Cross-platform:** Runs on Windows, Linux, and macOS.

If you're working with data that requires flexibility and scalability, MongoDB is a strong option to consider.
